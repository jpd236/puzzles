Twists and Turns is a format invented by
[Andrew Ries](https://www.ariespuzzles.com/). Turn answers weave through each
row of the grid, going left-to-right in the first row, then right-to-left in
the second, etc. Twist answers start or end in their middle square and proceed
in a spiral pattern (but not diagonally or overlapping).

Note: when solving digitally, all twists are configured to go from left-to-right
and top-to-bottom to avoid giving away the correct orientation.
