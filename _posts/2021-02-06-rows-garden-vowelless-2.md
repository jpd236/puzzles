After solving [Paolo Pasco](https://gridsthesedays.blogspot.com/)'s latest
vowelless puzzle for [Outside the Box Puzzles](http://www.joonpahk.com/blog/), I
started thinking about different variety puzzle types that could be combined
with vowelless puzzles - variety variety puzzles, if you will. This Rows Garden
Vowelless arose as a result.

Normally, there are a few difficulty choices when solving both vowelless and
Rows Garden puzzles, e.g. whether enumerations are included, or whether you're
told where each of the bloom clues go. I think that with the combination of
puzzle types here, the only remotely pleasant solving experience is with full
enumerations and known bloom locations. But if you're _really_ interested in
challenging yourself and want to try a harder version, please reach out and
let me know what format you'd like!
