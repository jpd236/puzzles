Download: [JPZ]({{ '/public/puzzles/RowsGardenMini1.jpz' }})
[PDF (Easier)]({{ '/public/puzzles/RowsGardenMini1Easier.pdf' }})
[PDF (Harder)]({{ '/public/puzzles/RowsGardenMini1Harder.pdf' }})

This is my first attempt at filling a more challenging variety grid type; let me
know if you have any feedback! There are two versions of the PDF - in the easier
one (and in the JPZ and applet), you're given the location of each bloom. In the
harder one, you're only given the clues and will have to figure out the
locations yourselves. The PDFs aren't the best quality; hoping to spend some
time to polish them across the site soon.
