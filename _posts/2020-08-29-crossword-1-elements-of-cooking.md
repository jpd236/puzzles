This puzzle contains spoilers for today's Universal Crossword (August 29th,
2020), so if you haven't solved that already, you should
[solve that first](http://syndication.andrewsmcmeel.com/puzzles/crosswords)!

Dana and I submitted this grid to Universal Crosswords back in March, but found
out (in a very gracious reply) that we had been scooped on the theme by a couple
months. Now that the puzzle, by
[Christopher Adams](https://twitter.com/arctanprime), has been published, we
figured we may as well clue the grid and share it as a learning exercise. Of
course, the published puzzle is far more polished - I particularly like the
grid pattern and the fact that it includes the full name of the theme subject.

We hope you enjoy, even if the theme isn't a new one!
